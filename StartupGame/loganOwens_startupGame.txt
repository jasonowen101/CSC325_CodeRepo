Template to start your prep-code for the main method. 
Hint, this is where looking in the book at the prep-code and the flow of the game comes in. 


Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to tholf the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses
        SET a SimpleStartup instance

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position
        MAKE an array with 3 random numbers of ints within that range
        RUN setLocationCells method
        DECLARE boolean alive for the state of the game

    WHILE the Startup is still alive 
        GET user input from the command line
        CHECK the guess to see if it hit
        RUN checkYourself method
        INCREMENT numOfGuesses variable
        CHECK to see if the target is killed
        IF killed SET alive to false
    RETURN the amount of guesses it took to win the game or Result
