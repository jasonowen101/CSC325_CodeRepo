Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position

    WHILE the Startup is still alive GET user input from the command line

    CREATE a SimpleStartup object passing an array (with 3 numbers) starting with the random number in position 0 
      and  and ending with the random number +2 in position 2 ex [2,3,4] if 2 is the random number
        you will want to pass the array to the setLocationCells() method
    
    PRINT the method checkYourself() passing the user's input and increment numOfGuessed

    CHECK for accuracy of the ouput to ensure the user's input is indeed a hit, kill, or miss

    REPEAT the while, print, and check steps to ensure that all endcases of checkYourself() work 
        ex. you get a hit, a miss, and a kill all accurately
