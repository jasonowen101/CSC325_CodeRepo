Template to start your prep-code for the main method. 
Hint, this is where looking in the book at the prep-code and the flow of the game comes in. 


Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position
    make code that doesn't allow the number to go outside the boundaries or set the parameters to shorter numbers

    WHILE the Startup is still alive GET user input from the command line

    IF stillalive is false because numberOfShips equals kill count break from the loop and end game 
    then print number of guesses as the score rating
