Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses, default = 0

    DECLARE a boolean variable that tells if the game is active still or not, gameActive is true

    DECLARE a boolean variable that tells if the startup is sunk or not, startupSunk for all Startups is false

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position

    WHILE gameActive is true

        WHILE the Startup is still alive GET user input from the command line

            WHILE user input is not in range {(0,0), (6,6)}:
                
                PRINT error message
                
                GET new user input from command line
            
            IF user input is equal to Startup position

                PRINT hit

                IF all Startup cells are hit

                    PRINT [Startup] sunk!
                    startupStatus is sunk
            
            ELSE

                PRINT miss

            COMPUTE numOfGuesses + 1
        
        IF all startupSunk is true

            SET gameActive to false
    
    PRINT You won! Number of guesses: numOfGuesses
