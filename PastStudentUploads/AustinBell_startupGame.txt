Template to start your prep-code for the main method. 
Hint, this is where looking in the book at the prep-code and the flow of the game comes in. 


Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position

    WHILE the Startup is still alive GET user input from the command line

    PASS the user's input into the "checkYourself" method, which determines if a hit has been made and counts how many hits have occurred.

    REPEAT the last two lines until the method returns "kill."
    
    DISPLAY a victory message when this occurs and give the option to end the game or restart.
