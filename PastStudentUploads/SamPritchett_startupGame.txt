Template to start your prep-code for the main method. 
Hint, this is where looking in the book at the prep-code and the flow of the game comes in. 


Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position

    WHILE the Startup is still alive GET user input from the command line

    Save user input to variable guess.
    
    Send guess to CheckYourself

    While result != "Kill!", get user input again and save it to variable guess

        Send guess to CheckYourself

    If result == "Kill", end game. Output # of guesses used.

        Ask if they want to play again. 

    Repeat while until game is over
