Template to start your prep-code for the main method. 
Hint, this is where looking in the book at the prep-code and the flow of the game comes in. 


Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position

    WHILE the Startup is still alive GET user input from the command line

        Display the result of the checkYourself method to the user
        IF the value returned is kill tell the user and display their number of missed and end StartUp
        ELSE IF the returned value is not kill display if the user missed or hit but not killed
        go back to the beginning of the loop where user input is asked for
