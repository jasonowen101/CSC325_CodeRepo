Template to start your prep-code for the main method. 
Hint, this is where looking in the book at the prep-code and the flow of the game comes in. 


Method public static void main(String[] args)

    DECLARE an int variable to hold the number of guesses, named numOfGuesses

    MAKE a new SimpleStartup instance

    COMPUTE a random number between 0 and 4 that will be the starting location cell position

    MAKE an int array with 3 ints using the randomly generated number, that number incremented by 1, and that number incremented by 2

    INVOKE the setLocationCells() method on the SimpleStartup instance

    DECLARE a boolean cariable representing the state of the game, named isAlive. SET it to true.

    WHILE the Startup is still alive 
    
    GET user input from the command line

    // CHECK the user guesses

    INVOKE the checkYourself() method on the SimpleStartup instance

    INCREMENT numOfGuesses variable 

    // CHECK for Startup Death

    IF result is "Kill" 

    SET isAlive to false (which means we won't enter the loop again)

    PRINT the number of user guesses
